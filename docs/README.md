# Docs

`SPEC.md` is the single source of truth for the library spec (current behavior and planned designs).

## Files

- `SPEC.md` — authoritative library specification
- `DECISIONS.md` — non-authoritative decision log / rationale / history

## Doc Hygiene

- Put normative behavior and planned designs in `SPEC.md`
- Put rationale, tradeoffs, and dated decisions in `DECISIONS.md`
- Avoid session transcripts and duplicate design docs
